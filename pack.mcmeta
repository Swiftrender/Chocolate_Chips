## Please appreciate the rainbow subtitle I had to do it by hand lmao

## Heavily inspired by the Plastic texture back from the console editions of Minecraft, but with friendlier textures and menus.


## Uses textures by myself and the following users:

## Micrac (https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/vanilla-improvements-1-13-2-2/)

## ZodaInk (https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/unique-spawn-eggs-1-13/)

## VanillaTweaks (https://vanillatweaks.net/)

## Revamp (https://darkstormpt.wixsite.com/revamp)

## Unique Spawn Eggs (https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/1-13-1-16-unique-spawn-eggs/)

## I don't remember exactly where I got most of the GUI textures but this pack works fine
