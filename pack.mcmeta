## Heavily inspired by the Plastic texture back from the console editions of Minecraft, but with friendlier textures and menus.


## Uses textures by myself and the following users/sites:

## Micrac (https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/vanilla-improvements-1-13-2-2/)

## ZodaInk (https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/unique-spawn-eggs-1-13/)
